I run 3 hour sessions. Attention spans wander after that, mine included.

This is maybe the only thing about COVID that I will miss. During the height of the pandemic, my players and I all got quarantined around the same time. We would normally only play 2-3 hours before someone would get bored or have other plans to leave for. During quarantine, we played multiple 10-12 hour sessions because they were going stir-crazy.

Those were some of the best D&D sessions I've ever had.

We honestly weren't even that close before the quarantine. Now we all stay in touch regularly, even though we don't play anymore due to too many schedule conflicts.

At the start of the shutdown we started curse of strahd and in our first session I managed to run character intro scenes and all of death house. It took about 9.5 hours not including breaks. One of the best sessions I ever ran but I don’t think I’d ever be able to pull it off again

We do the same, everyone in your group either has kids, crazy work schedules or both so we designate a Saturday every 6 weeks or so and do a full day with pizza, beer and a couple of breaks.

Pro DM is indeed a career path, and if you get 5 players paying you $20 each in a party for a 4 hour game and you do two games a day, you can be making $200, which is $20 an hour assuming a couple of hours of prep. I mean, that many games and that stable of parties is unlikely, but I think it wouldn't be out of the question to make $15 an hour as a pro DM if you're good.

Yeah, if everyone *including the dm* is still good after 5-6 or even 8-12 hours. then do it.
But a decade into running games, I try to stick to three hours of play time. It's honestly the best. Especially with half of my main group having add/adhd

Quite frankly, the main reason to stop sessions after 3-4 hours for me is prep. We do weekly sessions, and I simply don't have time to prepare more material to the standard I'd be satisfied with. Even more importantly, the longer a session runs, the more unexpected things can happen that I didn't prepare for. I want to encourage players to do whatever they want, but that can mean having to prepare for whatever whacky thing they came up with.

This is the way. I shoot for 3 hours every time and we play once a week with the rare exceptions (needing an extra week for prep, holidays, whatever). Obviously sometimes it goes longer, we played for 4 hours today for example, but that just happens in the sessions where everyone seems into going longer and I have enough content prepped and/or enough brainpower to keep improvising if that's where things headed. For the most part we always end right around 3 hours, give or take 15 minutes.

I usually aim for 5 hour sessions, where the first 30 mins is just smalltalk, then 2 hours of focused gaming, 15 minute bathroom/smoking break, another 2 hours of play, and then 15 mins to update character sheets etc.

I don't know how people do those 12h sessions and keep people focused on the game so long.

If you have the epic conclusion of a story ark it is awesome to sometimes play longer. And if you keep it to just sometimes then I find it's easier to keep your focus.

When I was younger, 6 to 10 hour sessions were the norm, now I am happy with 4ish, and so is everyone in my group. I like to use a natural break like a dungeon level change as a stop point. Though I am not opposed to breaking at the entrance to the "boss' room" for a cliff hanger, as it gives the player time between sessions to put fresh eyes on it, and polish their plan.

If they wanted to continue long into the night, clearly they were having a great time. Greed kills, in all things. Your friends would do themselves a service to learn that.

First: any time the group loses track of time, begs to keep going, or continues to engage, you’re doing an amazing job. No one wants to keep playing in a game they dislike. If they hated it, and you gave them the option to leave, they’d take you up on it, trust me. Second: just reading between the lines, but regardless of age your group has some immaturity issues. DMs do a ton of work for the group. If a player and DM don’t vibe, that’s perfectly fine, have an adult discussion, player can move on to another game with another DM. If they want to play in your game, the minimum is to say nothing mean (again you and player can have an adult discussion about a compromise for gameplay that works for everyone). Ideally they thank you and give you the desire to keep going with complements and snacks!

Op if you read this, consider whether or not you want to DM for them. That’s at least worth talking to them about. They’re being childishly mean for not getting their way.

If they enjoy your sessions, they will want to play more or forget how long it has been. I personally have played a 6,7 hour session. But how they are forcing you to play longer or being verbally mean like that, means red flags for future.

Yeah, consider mentioning this assholery in a diplomatic way, they might not be aware of their dickery. Do not expect them to fold and apologize right away, most people react very negatively to any calling out of negative behaviour. But you need to mention this now! Both to see if they can adjust their behaviour, now that they know they're being hurtful, and set up so future call outs are more effective. If you bottle up everything bad they do up, and vent all at once, they'll be caught unawares and probably brush it off. It is probably better to drip feed it and make sure they know every time they cross the line. And if you get tired of pointing out their bad behaviour because they don't try to change or apologize, then they might be assholes.

Edit: spelling.

This is super true. I'm guessing that this group may be mostly if not all young men/boys, because this sounds very much something like boys that age would do. (I'll be a bit frightened if they're much older than that.) Kids of that age aren't very aware of how what they say affects other people, and they're often stuck in pattern of "ragging on each other." Speak up. It can really make a difference, and if it doesn't., you've learned something very important about your so-called friends.

Might be best to talk to them individually in this case.

Oh yeah, good advice at the end. Most, if not all, young men tend to act tougher in groups, connecting with emotional stuff is easier if you're one on one. Then once you've settled things with them individually, and assuming everyone is willing to be nice, you can mention that everyone has had the talk, and hopefully open up for a more emotionally viable environment.

I cannot really speak on behalf of young women, I'll leave that to people with first hand experience But my intuition says that regardless saving face is easier if you learn that everyone is already on board.

Long sessions can be great sometimes. When I was in college and we all met in person, we'd go for like 5 to 7 hours, depending on how deep into it we got. But we've all got lives and shit now, and DMing can be demanding even when things go smoothly. Combat alone eats up a whole day's worth of my energy just from keeping track of things.

One of the games I play in, we go for like 3.5 hours on a long night, every two to four weeks, and we all have fun.

But frankly, session length isn't the problem here. The problem here is that those two players are horrible fucking people, and I hope someone crams a Lego cactus up their asses. That's not how mature people treat you, and that's not how friends treat you.

My session today went, honestly, not great. The players were chasing an assassin who had a whole suite of evasive abilities to frustrate capture because, y'know, they're an assassin. And the paladin's player was really frustrated by it. You know what she did? She said that she was really frustrated, and we talked about the reasoning behind both our positions, and everyone felt a bit better afterward. I still don't feel great about it, but I'm glad she trusts me to express that emotion and doesn't bottle it up.

TL;DR. Your friends are douchebags, and I cast a pox on both their houses. Boot their asses, because you're valid, and you deserve better than them.

I wouldn’t go as far as calling them “horrible fucking people” because I believe they just have terribly unrealistic expectations of how D&D goes, since everyone is new and I feel like with good bit of time, they’ll straighten out, so I don’t want to boot them. Plus, they’re the only people that made it to both sessions and we’ve been playing at one of their houses

Look, I'll admit I might be hyperbolizing a bit there (though I maintain that they deserve the Lego cactus enema), but the fact still stands that rating your friend like that, to their face, is a dickhole thing to do.

I don't know how old you are, but I can solidly say from some experience that waiting and hoping for someone's behavior to improve is a recipe for disappointment. Some people get there act together, plenty keep on being assholes. Unrealistic expectations are understandable, new player energy is understandable.

But insulting your friend after they devoted time and energy to making a fun experience is NOT something I'm forgiving of. My friends and I rib each other, even dunk on each other in the right moment. But never in my life, after they've spent four hours running a game, would I say something like they did. It's beyond ungrateful.

Being a DM means spending time and energy on a whole array of things. Even just running a module takes work. And pissing on that effort the way they did is the kind of slimeball behavior I'd expect of schoolyard bullies, not friends.

Unrealistic expectations or not, they tried to push your boundaries. When you didn't give into that, they resorted to passive-aggressive name-calling. That's not good-person behavior. It's bullshit behavior. The only reason people act that way is because 1) they think treating others like shit is fun and cool, and 2) they think they can get away with it. It's really got nothing to do with you; they just suck. And until they learn to treat people better, they'll continue to suck.

If I were in your shoes, I'd address their shitty behavior directly with them and let em know I won't tolerate it again. If their response was anything but "yeah man, we were wrong to do that, we're sorry and won't do it again," boom, friendship over.

Remember, no matter what you do, you're always teaching people how to treat you.

Their comments are incredibly disrespectful, even if they meant it as a joke. When people disrespect you outside of a game how do you react? I, for one, tell people how I perceive that and let them know that their behavior won't be tolerated. I would recommend you consider doing the same.

Not every GM can play for ages and, from what I've read, the majority of modern players seem to prefer a max of 4 hours. I admit, this isn't for me - four hours is the minimum I'll run and I prefer 6-8 or more - but that's the style popular in my generation of gamers and shouldn't dictate how you play.

So long as everyone is having fun and no one is being harmed, you're doing well. It's a good sign that the players want to keep playing your game and if they really thought you were as bad as some of them claimed, then why would they want you to keep running?

If they keep coming back, you're doing it right.

My friends and I are modern players. So we might fit into your mold, but I'd add to that that the short sessions (4ish hours) are very roleplay heavy. I can run combat for a long long time, but role-playing a lot, switching in and out of characters, remembering what they would know and coming up with natural reactions absolutely kills me after 3 hours. I couldn't continue after 4 hours of that.

Well either way, that sucks man. Main metric you can use for “am I a good gm” is “is everyone having fun, myself included.” That’s the baseline.

Fwiw, I run 4 hour sessions, and cut it off there, even when people wanna keep going, with a 15 minute break at the two hour mark.

Is just session length the only issue? I’m betting there’s more going on than just session length.

Look, you only have so much in you a day or week etc, if 2-4 hours is what you can do without hard straining yourself then they need to chill, it’s harder to DM than play, it can be quite draining. Especially if the energy around the table is negative or hostile. Maybe one of them wants to DM?

I think if you want to be a DM you should be a DM. Don't feel like you have to be a player. I'm a DM, and I have been a player and I prefer being a DM.

I think this is just people not respecting your time, regardless of what is or isn't good about your sessions.

Sit them down and tell them what you want out of the game, ask them to accept it, or find a party that works with you. It's a game of compromise not a game of majorities.

I prefer being a DM.

As I once explained to a player: Players get to be a character; I get to be all the characters.

After 30 years of DMing, I go a little crazy trapped in a single character's mind for 4+ hours the couple times I've played.

I donno, maybe I'm a control freak, maybe it's something else, but just playing doesn't really draw me. I love laying out puzzles and watching the players figure how to solve them. Are they going to hit it with sharp metal thingies? Are they going to talk to it? Are they going to get distracted and then panic when the problem has moved and now they have to hunt for it, or worse, it comes hunting for them?

Sometimes it's hard to empathize something without experiencing it. I've had a couple players run one shots and they suddenly have a whole new level of respect for DMs.

No you’re not a bad DM. In fact you are a good DM because you realized your limits and did not give in to peer pressure. Have you considered playing one shots/ short campaigns with other people? It will give you a better idea in how d&d plays in general. You can ask your local friendly game shop (if you have one), lfg reddit or looking for groups on roll20.

They’re being super unappreciative, immature, and borderline abusive with those comments. If it’s your second session, it’s really only gonna get better from there and like most things it takes practice and experience to do well. I’m really glad you already have the confidence for it, don’t let this shake you!! (And to answer the actual question no you’re not a bad dm for setting your own time boundaries! Especially reasonable ones, that’s healthy)

It’s worth noting that not every player is the right fit for a given DM and vice versa. I DMed for some close friends who interrupted like crazy, made a total mockery of it, etc. and they weren’t invited back. And in my longer campaign I had a lot of honest but difficult conversations with another friend who had endless complaints. In fact thinking back on it, all my irl friends I’ve DMed for have been my worst players hands down lol

Truth is we’re putting in a lot of work and doing our best to provide a happy and safe space for players, and I was most empowered when one of my players insisted that I should also be having fun instead of feeling just exhausted session after session. Once that really sunk in over a couple months time, everything fell into place and our game is phenomenal. Find players who work with you not against you.

I think DMing, like a physical activity, requires practice and training and growth. It's your second session; 4.5 hours is your current stamina level, and that's great. One day it may be higher, but don't feel obligated to go beyond what you can do.

Talk to them, tell them that it takes very much time to prep everything and that playing as a DM takes much more energy than as a player. If they dont believe you and dont stop mocking you, step aside for a month and let them DM 6-8 hour sessions.

Have played since the 1980s. Back then, we'd play stupidly long sessions; 10 hours plus wasn't uncommon on a Saturday. Then we'd also do Wednesday nights for 4-5 hours.

These days it boggles my mind how we managed that pace. I both played and DM'd in that era and I can't possibly do that now. I like 3-4 hours of play best these days.

I've been in dnd as player and dm for about 8 years with about 3 dozen different people and at least a dozen different groups.

90% of our sessions were between 2 and 3 hours.

This may come off as condescending, but what age is this group? Cause those players sound like they have the maturity level of middle schoolers.

Easy solution, tell those players that if they don't like how you DM, they can run their own game. But if they want to play in your game they need to respect your time and efforts.

Frankly if these were my players I'd probably be inviting them to leave.

I would tell them I thought a lot about it, and maybe I should level up as a dm with another group. Wouldn't want to ruin their fun with your low DM level they gave you, and your tiny 4.5 hour sessions. Maybe it's best they find a new dm for now, a high level one that can give them the 10 hours 5 level up session they want. ;)

My previous table did 6 hour sessions. I DM’d for the first time last week and accidentally pushed 4.5 hours due to having to change my location mid-combat (unforeseen crowding where I was at lmao oops), and that felt too long for me.

DMing is exhausting after so long plus all the campaign/map building one does as well. I've been in two campaigns. One ran for around 5hrs. We all had fun but like one commenter said, everyone lost momentum as the session went on. The second and current one I'm in runs for about 3hrs which seems to work great for all involved. So, no, you're not a bad DM. You can only build so much for each session without burning yourself out between meet ups.

And your players sound like selfish turdlickers. I'm sorry for their unkind words towards you.

I personally prefer 4-5 hour sessions. I currently play in a campaign with 2.5-3 hour sessions. And my DM is great!

Your ability as a DM is not bottle necked by the time youre able to sit down and run this thing.

This is a red flag in my books, you are a player in this group(who holds the role of dm) your wants and needs are just as valid as these assholes(sorry if they are your friends it's what they are depicted here as). If they want to play more they can play your game and then play another game, if not tell them to fuck off and have a good day.

I run 2-3 hour sessions, with a 10-15 minute break halfway in. A couple of my players have ADHD, and it really helps to keep their attention, and gives me a chance to use the bathroom and do a mini prep if combat is about to start/get the next part of the adventure ready. You should only run for as long as you feel comfortable for; it takes more mental energy and time for a DM to prep/run a game than the players to play.

I have played 2 hour sessions where the DM was awesome and on top of everyone so it was 2 hours of straight playing not memes and shenanigans.

I have also DM'd 8 hour games that range from 90% game to 40% game and 60% memes and shenanigans.

The amount of time you play for has nothing to do with how good a DM you are. Your players having fun is what makes a good DM. And if they didn't want to stop then you did a good job. That said, their reactions afterward make them not people I would DM for in the future.

Sounds like you’re doing a great job if they want to keep playing. Also sounds like they’re jerks.

For the record, 4-5 hours is a perfect session for the groups I’ve played with. That said, if you’re tapped at 3 hours, don’t feel bad. That’s a good game length. It also enforces that this is Dnd time not chat/phone time. Use it to your advantage.

I've only dm'd for one campaign (on pause for holidays) and I'm not the greatest at all. I run a loose goosey world and probably too many players but we are having fun, and I ask my players for feedback. Our time runs about 4 hours and by that time people are getting antsy to go take care of responsibilities or other things so I couldn't imagine doing any longer than that unless it was pre-planned and I had time to prep for 50 scenarios / decisions.

If I ever heard something similar to this, I'd drop the campaign and never speak to these people again, because that would crush my soul.

I agree with the others, where you're clearly doing really well that they want to play several more hours with you, that's a good sign. But the insulting two are definitely not there with the intent of "collaborative fun" h but just going to be selfish.

Personally, I'd dump them, but maybe you can bring it up at the beginning of your next session or privately. Your time is as valuable as there's, and you didn't appreciate what was said, and if they have a problem they can run their own campaign.

(I realize this is probably really brash to say, but their attitudes have me annoyed for you! I hope you are able to resolve this though! Don't let bad players make you feel bad for your decisions or time.)

I start my sessions at 7:30, and I end at 10:30, and my players love it. Ive run longer, and Ive run shorter, I enjoy longer, but not everyone can handle that much time. I think 3 hours is plenty long for a new DM, and 4+ hours is more than generous in any game. There is a learning curve and a DM style that everyone needs to figure out for themselves, and nobody should be shamed for not being able to run marathon sessions in their first times.

Sounds to me like you have a couple of shitty players. There is nothing that mandates you run longer games. I think a lot of players forget that the DM is 1) a human being with lives and demands outside of the game they run, 2) already are pouring lots of effort into the game to ensure they run it well (especially if you do Roll20 or something and you have to manually enter everything in), and 3) the DM is supposed to be having fun, too. If you are stretching yourself too thin because you are trying to accommodate these two ungrateful players, you'll burn yourself out and then everyone loses.

Your players sound very young and immature.



My sessions last 3 hours, max. That's enough for me to prepare for. I always leave on a cliffhangers which provides groans of disappointment and pleas to keep going, but I'm always adamant.



Many players don't realize the work that needs to go into prepping for a session, or how tiring it is to run a session more than 3 hours.



I would first tell them that their thoughtless comments about my playstyle did hurt my feelings and it's making me reconsider whether or not to continue providing a game for them. If they want to keep playing, they need to be considerate and polite or they can find another table. I would also make it clear that you have a start and end time and you will be sticking firm to it. When they can expect a stop time and know it is coming, you'll get less grief.

There's being sad that you still wanted to play. There's being annoyed about it.

Then there's being an asshole to the person doing 90% of the work. Their comments are manipulative and aimed to be hurtful, and not ok.

This is a red flag. Maybe you need to talk to them about it, or just look out for further red flags. But prepare yourself to possiblybhave to jettison them from the game if they stay toxic.

My sessions run 3-5 hours. Longest session I ever ran was around 6 hours, when the party was fighting a giant gelatinous cube with 777 hp, chipping it down from range for a few (irl) hours.

I try not to run more than 4 hours out of respect for the players and their sleep schedules (we run at night), though sometimes I'll go over to finish a sequence or get to a good stopping point.

DMing is a hard role. Massive respect to anyone who even attempts it. Even with a good party it can be exhausting; running an entire world for hours on end isn't easy.

I could probably run for longer than 6 hours, but honestly I'm not sure I want to even if I could. Saying "oi yall we've been running for 4.5 hours and I'm worn out" is a completely legitimate reason to stop a session. You are doing the hardest job at the table and should not feel bad about needing to cut it off.

Your friends are excited and want to play more. That means you are doing great my friend. Sounds like you may not have set expectations before hand about how long sessions were going to go. I would set a concrete start and finish time for your sessions so nobody is surprised or disappointed when you end. If you manage their expectations and they have fun I doubt they will complain.

If those players keep up their bad attitudes, dump them and find new players. Players are a dime a dozen. You, sir, are the valuable member of the group. You are willing to DM and that makes you the most important one at the table. Don't let this get to your head but the players need to respect that without you, they don't have a game. And you can always remind them that if they don't think you are doing a good enough job, they can always try to be the next DM.

IMO it's totally up to the DM to choose the maximum session length! It takes WAY more time to prepare for a session as a DM than as a player, and more mental energy while playing as well. Even as a player I don't love going over 4 hours, but as a DM I'd have to be in the perfect mindset to be able to survive doing it regularly!

Lol, no. I think your players are being dishonest about it too. If you weren't a good DM they wouldn't want to play more. Them wanting MORE is the highest compliment possible, despite them being pricks about it. I legitimately always want to play more and am always disappointed that we end sessions when we do. But DMing is a ton of work, and they need to appreciate that you're fucking generating a world for them, you can't just do that without prep. I've been playing fairly continuously since 2016 now, easily hundreds and hundreds of sessions since then, and I can count on one hand the amount of sessions that were longer than 5 hours. Honestly, that's probably true for 4 hours also.

I play 1-2 hours.

Your edit give me an idea. Try having each session ending with a goal that has been accomplished. It sounds like your friends are looking forward to leveling up. They need more things to look forward to.

Try having something that is accomplished each session that isn’t “kill the monster”. Have the session start with something that their characters want. Even ask them what they are wanting to accomplish. Make it your goal as a DM to give them something. Like a quest resolution, an NPC that they help and is thankful, a goal accomplished towards the campaign end.

They need that satisfaction of completion. It comes in many ways, one being leveling up. Give them something that they can pump their fist in the air and say “yeah!”

I mean I could easily play for 6-8 hours a day 5 days a week. But my typical sessions are way closer to 3-4 hours. 4 if I'm lucky. I get where your friends are coming from wanting to play more, but not having it in you to go that long by no means makes you a bad DM. Especially with how new you are to it.

Running a game takes a lot of mental, creative, and emotional energy. You have to jump into the heads of multiple characters, develop and describe the world and the story as they progress. And deal with all there shenanigans as they completely bypass everything you planned and are forced to improvise.

It's a lot, they are just caught up in the moment and have misplaced their gratitude. And honestly thats what this kind of criticism is, because if they actually thought you were a bad DM, they would not be asking for longer sessions.

A few things:

Take your players wanting to go longer as a compliment. They loved your storytelling so much, they didn't want to wait until the next session.

If they are serious, that's messed up. Talk to them. Tell them how you feel.

As for the Level-Up thing, I would hope that they are joking around. In my friend group, there is a running joke. At the end of every session, someone will ask if they are leveling up. It doesn't matter if it's been 5+ sessions since the last Level-Up, or if we already Level-Upped that session. It's a joke. I hope.

There are people who would want to do 7-8 hour sessions, but you don't seem to be one of them. You're not in the wrong for not wanting to play for more than 4 1/2 hours.

First of all, good job! They like your campaign. Keep it up.

Short answer No. Extension on said answer... What would make someone a bad dm has nothing to do with time spent on sessions. Most of the time people only have time to do a couple hours. Sometimes the dm just doesn't wanna keep going for that long (in your case) and probably dealing with player nonsense. they sound real douchey and in their own world.

That's around where I start to cap out as a player. My stamina tends to be shorter as a DM. There are definitely people who can do longer sessions just fine and some of the people I play with would consider "I start DnD as soon as I wake up and keep playing until it's time for bed" an ideal session length. Everyone is a bit different and you need to do what is comfortable for you.

In my case, I had to put my foot down as a player on us running long sessions because for the longer sessions I was losing my enjoyment and was definitely not playing well anymore. As a DM, I run until I feel like we are at a good stopping point which is usually before anyone else is tired of DnD but is where I'm starting to feel the strain.

Hello,

You are not a bad DM. I normally run games fir 6.5 hours or longer. But I've been doing this for 17+ years. DMing is a lot of work and your work will almost always go under appreciated. There will be plenty of good moments and who knows, forever DMing isn't for everyone, but no, 4.5 hours is plenty of time. They are playing 1 person/character. You have to manage the entire world on your shoulders. It can be stressful and tiring. With you being a fresh DM, I'm impressed! I know my games run long, and I know my players love longer games, but truthfully, we end games early for me. Everyone is different and you are not a bad DM. It sounds like you have pretty bad players though. If they are actually mature enough, you should be able to bring up that what they said hurt. But you know them best.

You're finding your method, which is fine. But, you're gonna have to deal with some of that for a bit. It's easier with a supportive figure or group though. I am sure you're doing fine.

Here's what you're gonna need to do: 1) Come clean with them about how you're feeling. Honestly. It can be hard to talk about that, but, if it hurting you, it's better not to play. There's better groups out in the world for you, this doesn't need to be the one where you find your sea legs. 2) Set the law. This may sound very Player Vs. DM, but make sure that they do what you say when you ask for it or tell them. If they level, make sure they know they only level the one time, not as many as they want. 3) It's okay to be hard on yourself. That's part of being a DM in the beginning, you're building your foundations without an instruction manual. If you feel like you can only run for three or four hours, that's fine. You're doing the heavy lifting, you're the one who can tap out any time you want to.

Keep gaming and don't give up. You're not an expert DM, you're a novice. Eventually, you'll graduate to apprentice, then journeyman, then you'll be a master at this.

it sounds like you're all fairly new, maybe they're just overeager? 4hrs is perfectly standard. my group stops after about 1.5 unless there's major stuff happening tbh. our first few sessions we all wanted to push it, but as much fun as we were having, it started getting really difficult to focus and remember things.

make it clear that sessions will be X hours in length, rounding up or down to wrap up encounters, and that you decide when they level (maybe use milestone for awhile to cool their jets). and that while you're open to feedback, it needs to be more fucking constructive than "DM on demand." if they want to play a different way, they can DM themselves. maybe explain that each hour of play can take a few hours of prep work, and why their comments were incredibly demotivating, but it sounds like it's time for another session 0

Around 3 hours is pretty normal. Leveling every 3-4 sessions, assuming the party is making good progress is also pretty normal. The longer the session, the longer it also takes to prepare.

A DM has such a higher mental workload than a player.

When you're a player, all you need to think about is what your character can do, and what is happening around you.

As a DM you have to think about ALL the characters plus the enemies plus what is going on around them plus what is going on next, and that's before we even get onto the fact you are tracking things like initiative, several sets of HP, different attack rolls.

So getting mentally exhausted quicker than players is expected.

Ultimately, the game runs for as long as the DM wants it to. If your players want longer games, tell them you're happy to play in a game they DM.

I have one group that meets online every week, and we do about 2, sometimes 3 hours, I have an IRL group that meets once or twice a month and we do 3-5 hours with a couple breaks

I prefer the shorter and more frequent games myself

No.

Everyone has a different life, lifestyle, schedule, and all sorts of other personal things that can effect game length.

I've been a member and DM of in-person and online games that last almost 8hrs a session and ones that last as little as an hour. Now, most shorter sessions meet more frequently, but still ... each group is different.

Over the last decade, most of my gaming has moved more and more towards online, and I prefer about 3-4 hr weekly sessions. But I have also played in 1hr daily sessions where we played intensely for a few weeks.

In college, we had a regular game that lasted 2 hours every Mon, Wed, and Fri afternoon for a whole semester because we all needed something to waste time while we waited for our next class because we all had the same Bio class followed by the Bio lab with no classes in between.

That's probably the most memorable Castle Ravenloft game I've ever been a part of (3rd Edition, circa 2002).

My group plays for 6-7 hours every session, but we're a bunch of dickheads who mess around, I often wonder how many other groups do this well and end up having played many fulfilling hours of D&D each week. There's nothing wrong with short and sweet sessions as long as you're doing a reasonable amount of stuff.

no you are not

the onus for content and the game is on you, so keep yourself fresh and energetic

the DM level thing is straight up awful behaviour, especially as you are a new DM.

Bigger picture, try to not cave to the players. There is a trend, especially in newer groups to transfer computer game RPG style practices to TTRPGs. Specifically the need for more instant gratification and accelerated progress etc. This can weigh heavily on a GM as they want to deliver what the players want/demand.

Not at all, it gets exhausting to be a DM. We are always on the spot. Players get breaks. We are always making decisions, thinking of what next, planning etc. It is tiring.

Get used to people asking when they are gonna level up next. People want the reward not the journey to get there as much as dnd is an adventure game players would be happy to walk into a room then level up then walk to the next room and level up. As a dm it's your job to refrain from giving everyone everything they ask for or else the darkness will unfold and you can't close pandoras box once it's open...also yes 4 hours is good to stick to if you feel not everything you wanted to happen happened that's your key to work on your getting back on track tactics....fun is number one but when the off topic stories and joking drags on it kills the resolution of the session and that isn't fun or satisfying...but there are polite ways to ask friends to focus up and reorient the topic back to the game at hand...

Largely depends on the groups and the time people have.

I've known some groups to go entire weekends 48 hours of folks sleeping over. Those are rare though.

Most sessions tend to be around 3-5 hours I've found. Unless your doing something like a play by post game (Really hard for D&D but easier for other systems) where its a 24/7 "whenever you have time to post" sorta deal. Some of those can go longer back and forth.

Wow. It’s rare to answer “No” to any AITA. But, you’re the DM. Anytime you’re “spent,” then just say that you’re ending there and next time will be the part two.

It really depends on the participants. I have had a session with newbies and they needed a break after 2h and after 4h they were done. Just yesterday I had a group of "pros" and we played 7h straight and only stopped bc one of them had an arrangement at that point.

That beeing said, I would go with the maximum that is possible for everyone. And if you as a dm feel drained after 4h then there isn't much to be done but to stop. You are in it for the fun too. Over time you might be able to keep it up and running longer but there shouldn't be any pressure, especially if you are new. And telling you that you are a bad dm after your second session ever just bc it ended after 4 1/2 h... that's really shitty of them.
By the way: kudos for starting as a dm without ever having played as a player. Makes it all way harder.

Also: communicate from the start that you plan a 4h session. that way the players know what's comming (and for how long) and won't be as unhappy when time is up.

I've done a single 9 hour session. It was incredible, but for a week after I had to recover. Part of that is because of mental illness, but it was also just seriously draining.

I've run weekly 6 hour sessions for a year or so. Tons of fun, but it was half my weekend gone everytime. A huge commitment, plus the other weekend day I'd be really tired from preparing 6 hours of content all week and then playing it all out.

I now stick to 3-4 hour sessions. They're the ideal length for me. Substantial enough to get a good bit done, and short enough that you can stay focussed the whole time. My players also always want more at the end of a session, and I do too, but that's great because it's an incentive to plan in the next session ASAP.

Your players were blunt and thoughtless. It happens, people don't always think before they talk. But communicating with them about this is vital, because this isn't the atmosphere that leads to fun DnD campaigns. Especially if they're your friends, they should treat you better. The DM is also a player, just one with extra responsibility: you deserve to have a good time.

If that would be a criteria for a bad DM.

Matt Mercer would be a bad DM.

ADVICE: when your players complain about the session timeframe ask them: Maybe one of you want to DM longer sessions. I would have a Character Sheet at the ready just in case.

A lot of new players forget it isn't a computer game. If they have never tried to DM they have no idea how much work is involved.

My pet peeve is inconsiderate players. It manifests in a lot of ways, most commonly is not knowing their character, but also as the whole forgetting the DM is a person thing.

It’s your second session ever DMIng or playing? Yea you are probably an awful fucking DM but let’s be real everyone sucks at stuff they are learning,just like your players suck if it’s their second session… I personally would of recommended playing in a 2-3 year long campaign as a player before DMing but you’ll get better and so will the players, good luck working up levels from that -7 my friend.

My party typically does 5+ hour sessions (usually 1pm-6/7pm), personally I’d rather play for less time but most of the party would rather play for longer, it really changes person to person for how long the perfect session should be, as the dm it should be dictated by how long you can pay attention and do dm stuff well without it feeling like a chore

This sounds like an expectation thing. Always try to make sure everyone expects same/simular things from the game.

I'm in the opposite boat as you. I would play 8 hours if possible but people have life, jobs, a limited amount of free time and energy. My players can't play all day. I have wonderful players I love playing with. So most my games last 3 hours, but I always tell my players I can go longer if they want to keep playing.

End of the day if this is an issue bring it up and make sure everyone has the same expectations of what to expect.

4 1/2 hours is quite a lot of time commitment for a single game. This has no bearing on your skill as a DM, if it is causing stress or making the hobby less fun my advice is address it directly.

I get exhausted after four hours! Even with a 5 minute break I’m almost talking nonstop, doing various voices and keeping the action flowing. I usually end on a cliff hanger, thank them for the game, and yeet!

If people started whining I was still going I would just laugh. How incredibly rude to demand more! You aren’t a WOW server, you’re a human being.

4 1/2 is absolutely a reasonable time. I use to run around 5 both as a DM and player and near the end everybody was tired.

Honestly, the behaviour of those two players doesn't seems nice. Being mindful of the needs of other at the table is important. If they are interested only in their fun without caring that you cannot go on that is a pretty red flag.

Same for the comments on how good you are as a DM. I know that they can really hurt. It shows a lack of empathy that I personally wouldn't like in my group.

Don't let this discourage you from growing as a DM. Keep on playing. Try to be objective in your own judgement of yourself. And if your current group becomes too toxic find another one. No D&D is better than bad D&D.

I always say to my players that you should ‘reserve 4 hours for a session’. Often times we reach a satisfying stop point at 3 hours, often times we’ll get to 4 hours and someone will be getting restless, and sometimes, we get to the 4 hour mark and think ‘come on let’s just kill the boss monster and finish the quest today’ and then the session is 6.5 hours long but it is only like that through agreement

New DM here, we always play 4 - 5 hours. As much as they want to keep playing more, I always remind them that as a new dm, it's hard to stay on point after a few hours. I always use their long rest or a 'calm before the storm' moments as natural stops for the next session. I always tell them to treat it like a TV show where binge-watching it "may burn us out" or even unmemorable. It's always good to keep them in their toes and not surrender to their need to want more since as a dm, there's only so much you can prepare before the exhaustion limit turns the session "unfun" and "chore-like" for us. DnD should be fun for everyone, and that includes the DM.

I run 2-5 if it’s a single person it’s super draining, if it’s my preferred party size of three 4 is the real sweet spot before I’m exhausted. And 5 is for a table of 5-6 because I get lost easily. I’d just let them know. If you get a chance maybe try blocking out a weekend and planing a drop in drop out session where you have long breaks between sesssions but get to play multiple a day as a little treat, but don’t over extend yourself! Burnout is real! Let them know how it feels and that you appreciate their excitement for playing but their way of showing is hurtful

When you first start playing any game it's new and exciting, you want to play, explore, and progress. As a player sometimes it's hard to appreciate the energy/prep that a DM wil have put in to even play for 3 hours, let alone more.

I've played only with 2 DMs ever, both friends in the same group. The first is spectacular. The way he narrates and engages us all is exceptional. I always look forward to playing his sessions.

The other is a proper metagamer as a player, knows every single rule and enforces it. Says "um" every 6th/7th word, and in our 2nd session killed 2 PCs. It really put me off, and when he runs his campaign I don't play anymore, his content doesn't engage me at all.

Your friends aren't shitty people for wanting to play more. Imo that shows what a good DM you are. If you were a bad DM it ruins the experience and they wouldn't want to play. What they said was shitty though.

Just keep doing what you're doing, you set the rules, if your sessions go too long then you'll all get burnt out and the quality of your sessions will drop, then none of you will want to play anyway. Leaving people wanting more in this situation is definitely the best way to go.

Welcome to the hobby, please ask more questions and read some. It's always great to see new DMs!

It sounds like you're doing fine. Those players sounds like they were being assholes though. I totally get wanting to play longer but that's not the way to Express that sentiment productively.

I usually run for about 3 hours for two of my tables. Once a year I run a longer 1 shot for Halloween that sometimes runs 6-7 hours. My third table plays for 5 hours with a 30-45 min break. But when that group gets together in person we play for 10-12 hours (our record is 20, no not kidding).

So take it from a DM who does all sizes of session that you should end it if and when you feel like you should. Playing past that will result in a bad time for everyone. DMing can be tiring; don't try to do it for more time than you're comfortable with. I've stretched sessions for lots of reasons and it's never really been good.

There’s a lot of “those people are jerks” here, which may be true, but it sounds like they were razzing you and being a bit jokey because they didn’t get their way. People who have never DM’d will never understand the amount of time, work and sheer emotional and mental energy it takes. It might be worth just telling them it is surprisingly tiring and, while you love being their DM, it take a lot out of you. You are not a bad DM, they are not bad friends - it’s miscommunication. Keep up the good work!

Sounds a bit immature to me. The players, I mean.

One of my best D&D experiences (over time) was at this game store in a town I once lived in. Each Wednesday was the so-called Adventurer's League (but instead of what that usually means, it was a sort of come-all pick-up campaign. The game would always start at 6, and would always end a little after 9. For an adult with a job and schedule, it was a godsend. Not because it was short, but because it was consistent, and the DM was very professional and good at respecting everyone's time.

Everyone is different. I playing a game where we usually go for 6-8 hours but that also includes an hour lunch break. I also DM on where we usually play for about 3-4 hours with a 15 minute break.

There is also another difference the 6-8 hour one we often only play once every two months, while the 3-4 hour one we try to keep it at every second week.

So with all these factors combined i think the DM of the long game gets enough time to prep for long session, while I don't have that luxury.

Also those two seem like dick's putting a number on .how good you are based on the length of a session (and a pretty long one at that).

It is a game, so chill. 4h is pretty ok. It is good sign your players are hungry for more.

If they want more and you cannot provide, suggest one of them running a game, they will have a taste of what it takes, and you could be player for once.

My group and I go for 5-6h sessions with 30-40 minutes of breaks. However, we only play once a month.

If I had to be prepping for sessions every week, I wouldn't be able to go for more than 4 hours, period. Too much work and too little spare time to do it in a quality I expect of myself and my campaign.

As a professional DM, my players pay for 2 hour sessions. While I ussually run for 3-4 hours my players have no problem with a 2 hour session.

Might be worth having a chat with your players. Perhaps suggest that if they want more D&D one of them can run their own game after your one finishes.

No you’re not a bad dm, don’t worry it’s a good thing they want to play longer but don’t stretch yourself beyond your limits. They’re being mean with the levelling thing, that is just mean, I’d tell them you were hurt by it and say I just can’t prepare enough stuff for over 4 hours, you shall just have to wait in anticipation for next time.

Everyone has their own personal preference for session length. I’d argue that you, as the DM, has the right to set a session length and stick with it. You don’t need to push yourself beyond that, but setting expectations is always important.

I’m sorry you feel your players don’t appreciate you. I’m sure that if they want to participate in a longer session you’re doing a wonderful job.

As a side note, I prefer sessions around 4 and a half to 6 hours long. My friends enjoy that and the one friend who didn’t have the energy to play that long left the campaign I was running and the campaign one of my friends was running.

It’s all about finding people that click with your preferences.

You're not. Player was being a dick. Tell them that isn't cool and you don't appreciate it.

Let me tell you a story.

I've been playing roughly every week for the past ten years, my group plays 10-13 hour sessions with little to no problem. I'm usually a player, but whenever I DM for them I aim much lower: 8 hour sessions with a 30 minute meal break.

My girlfriend and her friends have recently been getting interested on the hobby, so I offered to DM for them. I ran a homebrew opener to an adventure set in my world, an opener my more experienced and savvy players LOVED when I had them play. A little mistery run around on a festival. It was gonna be a hit.

Until it seemed like it wasn't.

The reason I felt like it wasn't was, mainly, because after a the fourth hour they stopped engaging, phones started creeping out, and everything was overall going much slower. I was missing the fact that the players simply weren't Grognards who had spent their teenage years building the stamina needed to sit at the table for hours on end, but first-timers out to have fun. From that session onward, I started scheduling smaller sessions and all our issues just went away.

Different players lean into different styles of play, and playing long hours is hard, especially when you're inexperienced, ESPECIALLY when you're in as taxing a position as the DM. Not to say players who prefer shorter sessions are inexperienced, though. Lots of great (and greatly experienced) players also prefer not to go over four hours, not to mention most premade modules are paced with smaller session times in mind.

Do not let anyone judge your ability as a DM by session runtime. It sounds like your players were disappointed about not getting as much game-time as they wanted and decided to handle it as children.

If you were a bad DM they wouldn't be asking for more.

In any case, if you want to "level up" your DMing, keep in mind that it's about the flow of content. A 4 hour session with a good plan, containing buildup, tension and resolution can be more fulfilling than any 12 hour content mashup.

You do a tougher, more demanding job.

Also, this is a collaborative game. People gotta respect each other’s boundaries.

I ran with an online chat based group in a west marches style server and man, some of those guys could play all day. I'd want to, it was a blast, but I have other shit to do on a Saturday and can't devote an entire day to playing.

Hopefully your friends are just giving you shit like friends do. Turn it around on them and tell them to DM a session.

Spoiled player syndrome.

When you sit down at that table, you are god, and that is your domain.

Tell them if they don't like that god needs a break, they can run the game for longer and see how they feel.

No, but your players sounds like complete assholes. You are a good DM since they want to play more and setting personal boundaries are a good thing. Don't let others walk on you.

I ran a 6 hour session yesterday. Everyone's attention including mine went wasn't there by the 5th hour. Rules became fast and loose because combat dragged on and everyone wanted the fight to end.

At the end of the session, I passed out asleep on my bed.

I've run groups that go 8 hours. I've run groups that go 24 hours, and I've run groups that go 4.

Turns all, all that psychological research that shows human productivity and attention crashes after 4 hours are absolutely correct.

Not only are you not a bad DM for not being able to go longer than 4 and half hours, your inability to is scientifically supported as a reasonable amount of time.

Your players suck. You would have more fun at the table if you replaced them with ones who don't.

Telling a GM that he's a -7 out of 10 is intended to be hurtful to you. Saying that you're a -7 level DM is also intended to insult you.

I bookmark 3 hours per session, and we have a hard cutoff time so we never go longer, but we often end 20-30 minutes early. A good story takes time to write.

Everyone's times must be respected, I'm mostly a player lately but I dm too, I've had sessions ranging from 2 to 6h, they mostly always ended when someone needed to do something or felt it was taking too long (as both a dm and player I felt things were going great and fun but I didn't have any issue finishing at that point either way)

Wow, your "friends" were being ungrateful turds.

I'm someone who enjoys DMing more than I do playing, but that doesn't mean that it's not work! It's hard work running a game, nevermind all the preparation that goes into it.

Not gonna tell you what to do, but it's commonly said that going without DnD is better than bad DnD.

In many years I’ve run sessions of many lengths. From 45 minutes to several at 24 hours (yes really, they were for charity). I’d say 3-3.5 hours is about standard and on the edge of most players attention spans.

Nowadays I am long term disabled and the online games I run are 2hour and 2.5hour sessions respectively. Because my players need to finish work and take care of life and I can’t do late nights anymore.

The “level” of a DM (which is a very daft concept by the way) would never be related to time. The art of running lies in crafting a story, engaging players and being able to do both of these for 4-6 other people while still actually having fun yourself.

Your players need reminding that you are A: A player too and B: Dedicating a lot of time and energy to give them a world to play in.

I may be a dinosaur by now, but rule one at my table is Respect the Other Players at all times. Rule zero is The DM is a Player Too.

Don’t let it get to you and always stand up for yourself and call out the BS before it grows too much.

Just my tuppence worth

Man imma just Pur it this way, I DMd a session for 10 hours cause my players wanted to keep going, I was tapped out by hour 4, that session nearly made me quit dnd for good, as a dm if you can't keep telling the story, there's no story to be told in my opinion

You are the one who calls the session length. My sweet spot is 2-3 hours, after that I can see the attention span of all the players declining. They do want to play more, but I usually just end it there.

It just depends honestly. In college we ran 8 hour sessions on average, weekly. Now (with the same group of players) we wouldn't even dream of running over 4 hours and our average is 3.5 hours weekly.

Do whatever makes you as the DM comfortable, and if the other players still want more then they can find a second game to play during the week.

I was the guy your players are asking you to be. And having that experience, YOU ARE NOT A BAD DM FOR YOUR CHOICES.

Lvl 1 DMing skills, never played or DMed before just picked up the books and sat in the DM's seat... We would start at 1pm, take a break at 6-7pm for dinner and play until 10pm or 11pm. I had watched so much Matt Colville in prep to be a good DM. I went straight into a homebrew campaign and a story that should have taken 3 years was hammered into 2-3 months. And while the table comprised of people in their teens, their twenties, we had someone in their thirties and someone in their fourties/fifties play and despite every single one of us being enthusiastic to play the long hours. It was a horror story of a table.

Ignoring player personalities/play styles and the toxicity generated from that.

I did 0-2% planning. Anything I did plan was used up in 2 hours of gameplay.

That left 8 hours of google searches, improv or hoping players would drag out situations needlessly. Those moments where players would try every combination one at a time to only have me say "no" each time was a blessing (rookie move but I was desperate)

Any travel time was role-played for more IRL time.

I started getting burn out about 2 months in and instead of talking to the players, I decided to "wrap it up" by just speeding through the story as quickly as possible. That made the campaign sloppier than it was already (lack of planning didn't help).

I had an argument with a player because they didn't follow my design for their character and that ruined a full session almost (completely my fault).

I needlessly punished/bullied the Paladin for stuff as "story" but honestly was communication failure between the two of us.

I am stuggling to remember anything about the campaign itself as it was all rushed and no good IRL memories came out of it.

We loved playing D&D but the table lasted 6 months and 3 DMs before we were all burned out and called it quits. The table died mid-way through Princes of the Apocalypse because the DM running it couldn't take it any more.

I made so many mistakes because I was not experienced enough at the time.
Did the experience make me a better DM - Yes.
Would I do more 10h sessions - Yes, if I had the time IRL to do it and the players willing to invest the energy long term.
Was it the worst thing I have done as DM - Yes, absolutely. If I could change anything about that time. It would be at least cut the hours played per session in half.

As for your friends giving you a DM level. That is all bull. At the time I wouldn't have said anything, but now I would definitely chat with them and see if there is a middle ground that could be reached. I get why they are so excited to keep playing but as a DM, keeping it to just under 5 hours is good enough.

A great DM isn't someone who has invested years into DMing. A great DM is one who develops their skills, tries new things, makes mistakes and learns. Keep trying, keep learning, and keep breathing.

I mostly do 2 hour sessions but it's hard to schedule now that everyone has full time jobs. But even when we had less responsibilities the longest I ever went was 4 hours.

Sucks your players were being dicks. You all sound young and at least when I was that age it took me a long time to realize I was hanging out with A-holes and that I didn't actually have to.

Keep DMing though! It's a craft like any other and a lot of fun.

I used to do 4.5 hours on a Sunday with a break on the middle, and I'd be fried for the evening. A 3 hour session is what I run now, I may over run if I've got the energy or we're in combat. We would do 6+ hour sessions when we were in our early teens, but can't sustain that anymore.

Just chiming in to say our group plays once a week max for 2-3 hours because that is what works for us. There is no harm or failure in shorter sessions! It does seem like you and your party do not have the same expectations though, and having a Session Zero, even after a campaign starts, could be a big help. I think that's the key issue, aside from the fact that one of them was pretty damn rude to you. Other comments had good advice about how to tackle that issue, so i just wanted to say you are not doing anything wrong and that I hope you can find either some equilibrium or a group whose expectations for play are closer to yours.

Late to the party here, but here's my 2 cp:

You're a New DM you're supposed to suck at new things. Ask them to bear with you while your get your DM legs. It takes a while to find your own style and preferences. Even your preference for shorter sessions may change. After a year or two you'll have a better grasp of the challenges and be able to self-evaluate more accurately.

Another consideration is that your DM style may not fit with your players desired play style. This is a natural consequence of congregating as humans, sometimes our minds are just on different planes. It's going to take a while to figure this out as well.

Finally I would say to go with your initial "in the moment" instinct. When your friends were evaluating your "DM level" your instinct was that it wasn't malevolent. It was only upon reflection that you felt the ill intent. It's a coin flip, either you reflected and more accurately remembered, or you reflected and self-doubt crept in. Give your friends the benefit of the doubt and assume they love you, at least until such time as the opposite becomes undeniable. And as always, if you ever decide your friends are toxic and hanging out with them is bad for you just leave.

One of the biggest pieces of advice that I wish someone told me when I was a new DM is: you’re feelings matter just as much as the players. It seems really obvious but as the dm you can get this instinct that you need to make sure that your players are having fun at all times no matter the cost to yourself. You have to remind yourself that on top of being your players they are (hopefully) your friends too and at the end of it all they shouldn’t want you to burn yourself out on their accord. I would come to them and tell them plainly that “I only have the energy to run sessions that are about 4 hours at a time. Pushing any more than that I’m going to start getting burnt out.” If they’re your friends and good people they’ll respect that boundary, if not? Well they might not be people worth playing with anyway

Have either of these people DMed? I feel like most players don’t realize how mentally taxing DMing is. Your brain is thinking the entire time as you’re actively listening to your players, remembering all the details you may have plotted, and improving when your players do the unexpected. My first campaign, I was mentally drained after 2-2.5 hours but it usually took me an hour to wind down from being so amped up. My current group goes longer (4-5 hours) but if I tell them that we’re finished, I put my foot down if they push back. The one time I didn’t listen to my gut, the session ended in the middle of a combat with players arguing the semantics of a spell that they’d failed the save for and I didn’t have a satisfactory answer because I was too tired.

Your players sound like they don’t respect your time both in session and out of session. I think y’all need to have a conversation about expectations of you as a DM and them as players. But if they are not respectful of your time commitment and of you as a DM, you should reevaluate if they’re a good fit for your game. You are a player too and your fun matters just as much as theirs.

I run 5 hour sessions. The first 15 mins are recap, we have a 30 min break in between, and a 15 to 30 min aftercare within that 5 hours. So it's more like 4 hours of actual play.

I used to do 8 hours but after hour 5 I would find myself checking out mentally.

The trick is to improv rather than prepare - I can run a 12 hour game with 5 minutes notice if I need to (I have done so in the past). But it takes a lot of practice to reach that point, I've been doing improv style DMing for over a decade at this point.

Its just a matter of practice. You aren't good at things you've never done, but the more you do them the better you get.

And to practice this you don't have to try and improv a whole session. You can just reduce your prep/scripting a little bit at a time, have individual scenes where you aren't totally prepped and rely on improv a little bit in the moment. You can work up from there to improving an entire game with no notice. Just takes time.

Now clearly they are at least semi enjoying the game as they want to play longer. But there's feedback and there's being a dick. Constructive feedback is fine with me and I like it, I even annoyed my group early on in my DM-ing career when I asked too often for it.

If someone had said my DM-ing level was negative 7 I'd explain that what they said was just horrible, makes me not want to DM for them at all and give them one chance to redeem themselves/apologise and then kick them over the next instance of bad behaviour.

It's so needlessly dickheadish that I couldn't cope with it at all. I'm angry on your behalf.

And the levelling up question - unless they are level 1 - 2 in 4 hours then possibly I can see the need to get to level 3 soon.

All you can realistically say is that they should trust you and your judgement, that if you went on longer than 5 hours you'd run out of content and it'd become dull and that they should trust you to know when to level people up. If not, find another group.

I'd say that about 90% of all the games I've played over the last decade and a bit have been about 4 hours in length. So I think its totally reasonable for you to aim for that.

Maybe at some point you feel up to trying something more and plan out a full day game, but you don't need to rush into trying that, and if you never want to its totally ok.

The purpose of gaming is for everyone at the table to have fun, including you as DM. If you aren't enjoying it, thats a problem and you need to change things so you do enjoy it. If that means cutting a session at 4 hours, then thats what you do.

And your players saying you're a bad DM are being absolute dicks. I'm imagining they're not exactly prize winning players on their second session - DMing is a skill and takes practice to get good at. They should be supporting you in doing that, not criticising you.

Seems like the player is -7th level if their going to be so harsh an unappreciative. That’s a joke. I don’t condone making backhanded comments to people like that.

It seems like they’re having a lot of fun! If they’re that eager to play. Try to end on cliffhangers. For one it raises intrigue about the game so they’ll want to come back and usually that means you’ll start the next session with a bang. This is similar to a lot of TV shows to keep watchers/ players interested. And if they can appreciate this as at least an art they can understand. Hopefully they can appreciate the work and effort you put in aswell

As a DM, you are probably using more energy than anyone at the table. You can only prep so much material, and eventually you will hit the end of what you have prepared and use more energy to improv. It's important to pace yourself, and knowing a specific end time is very reasonable request. Your players passive agressive insults should not be tolerated, and you should quietly inform them that what they said was insulting to you after the time and effort you have put in to making the game. These two owe you an apology, though it sounds like they are invested in the game (don't let them peer pressure you into free level ups).

Some strategies to extend your DM endurance and prevent DM burnout: Take notes during sessions (or record them with player permission) to help make prep easier. That way when you have to improv and name an NPC, you have notes to make an NPC reference sheet later during prep. Encourage players to roleplay with each other in character. They don't need to be doing any voices, but if they are planning for something, tell them to speak to each other in game as their characters. If players are communicating anything to each other, they should always be encouraged to do so in character (meta stuff like rules and some jokes are going to be OOC, but things like strategy tips should be in character like shouting "Let's surround him" instead of "Dude, don't forget to position to get the flanking bonus.") This is something you need to gently encourage at first but a well-trained group will make for much less stressful sessions. You know you are doing it right when you as a DM can sit their mostly silent and watch them talk to each other in character for a while. Make sure to have specific time limits for sessions, and stick to them. If players are about to hit a big combat and you only have 45 min left, end early, or find a way to eat up some time by encouraging them to build their character through roleplaying discussions among themselves ("talk to each other in character about what your plans are going forward in the dungeon"). Most of all, make sure YOU are having fun. If something is happening that is taking the fun out of the game (like passive agressive player insults), shut that down and address it. You will have so much more energy if you love your game. "Stop passively insulting me, you are my friends and should be encouraging me. I'm not your enemy as the DM. I need you to help me do this by telling me what you loved in tonight's game, not needling me about what you didn't."

My sessions never go longer than 4 and sometimes not even that. It can be very draining on both you and the players to go that long. Just set the expectation for how long you have - you only have so much prepared for a session after all.

We used to do all day sessions and it’s exhausting. My ideal length as a DM is 2-3 hours. After that I stop enjoying myself. Be encouraged though that if the players want to keep playing you’re doing something right. Grading your DMing though is extremely rude.

I used to be in sessions that were 5-6 hours on weekday evenings, that was really painful. I'd rather 3-4 hours. Now that I play a lot online, I want even shorter sessions because it just isn't as fun to play that way, so at 2 hours on roll20 my brain tends to give up.

When I was in high school I could play for basically unlimited time. We used to play all day long.

Now that I’m an adult with a job and responsibilities I can’t do more than ~3hours. I get bored and anxious if it goes longer than that. I’ve got other things I need to do now! Groceries don’t buy themselves and all that.

The problem isn’t how long you played, it’s your terrible friends. What kind of dumpster fire of a person grades their DMs’ performance like that!!! Nothing wrong with a bit of constructive feedback (if solicited) - but that was not that. Personally I’d be done DMing for them. If they want to play they can DM

I have run sessions between 3 hours long and 16 hours long. The 16 hour sessions only happened cause I was 18 with no job and I was friends with the owner of a local game shop. That being said, my funnest sessions are between 3 and 5 hours. 5 hour sessions lead to progress in a good campaign. 16 hour sessions lead to lots of laughs at the table but mostly just bullshit happens. Also, it's your campaign, if they don't like the rules you made they are free to find their magic perfect DM. Good luck to em cause we are all looking for the master DM

Nope, but that's something to discuss at the beginning, just so expectations are clear.
Our group does about 2.5 hour sessions each week. Is that too short for some? Sure. But that's our sweet spot.

It's okay for your group to find yours. It's not too late to discuss it now!

It depends. To me, and typically my players, a stopping point is a stopping point. If the story is rolling and things are happening then 4 1/2 hours could feel like no time at all. 2 sessions ago we went fpr 6 hours and we couldn't believe it. You're the story teller for the day. When you are done telling your story for the day then the session ends. If that's 2 1/2 hours or 4 1/3 it's up to you.

We used to play really mammoth all day sessions and now we do 2 hr sessions twice a week: the quality of play is improved and people muck around less knowing the time is precious. Your two other players sound rather young/inexperienced, and it could just be a lack of perspective/over enthusiasm but it's still pretty rude of them. Back yourself, set rules and boundaries that are the best for everyone: any play is better than no play, anyone demanding more like that is just greedy. It's clear they still want to keep playing, so you did just fine, but may need to rein in their selfishness a bit if it gets more out of hand.

You're a great DM, OP, but for these a-holes getting a great DM means that you're their personal session dispenser, an adventure jukebox. I wouldn't want to play with them.

No but that doesn't preclude you from being a bad person in other areas if it's any consolation.

I've been in 4 campaigns as a player: 3-4.5 hour sessions.

My campaign: 4-4.5 hours.

I know some people play longer games, but as a DM I actually am glad it doesn't go past that. This gives me time to be creative with what happens next since my plans usually get derailed after 2 hours and the next 2 hours are just me BSing my way through my worldbuilding. XD

The inability to recognize that people have other responsibilities and desires than just playing D&D is the sign of a deeply immature person.

Offer them the chance to DM, tell them you can't wait to play in their game. How about they run it next time?

Those two players are being assholes. The "correct" length for a session is whatever the players & DM feel right about. I've had sessions only last 45 minutes because that's how long it took for a player to realize they were too tired from work for D&D. But I do want to focus on this for a sec.

The most generous one they said: level 1.

Being a level 1 DM on your second ever session playing the game isn't a mark of failure, it's to be expected. Life isn't like some D&D campaigns, you never start at level 3 to "skip the boring stuff".

A couple months ago I finished up a ~2 year long campaign I was DMing (my first-ish time DMing and my first time playing the game in like 7 years), and I was constantly thinking about all the things I would've done differently early in the campaign if I could go back and change them, and even now I'm thinking about things I would like to change from the end of the campaign.

And soon-ish, one of the players will be taking over as DM for their campaign, and I'll be a player, something I haven't done in now almost nine years. And I fully expect to be a "level 1" player, because I'm out of practice and wasn't very good at it even when I was in practice.

Newer DM here, maybe 20-30 sessions completed. I've only JUST opened myself to more than 4hrs because I wanted to keep playing. I was relaxed, having fun, and not stressed at the time. It's a call you gotta make at the time, don't rush. You're probably doing great. I think it's normal to be drained after 3-4hrs. Best thing I ever did so far was to relax in game.

Your friends are dicks. I usually run a game for 2.5-3 hours, and it's usually one of my players who decides they're done which causes the game to end... I'd be down with going for 4, but they don't manage to hold onto their attention spans that long. The one who's most likely to leave early I will still go on after they leave for a bit, but I try to make it a "wrap up this encounter" and then we end timing.

It's your second session. You're a level 1 DM indeed. On the note of players levelling up the average would be 2-3 weeks per level, no more than a month without a level up, just to give enough time for them to get comfortable with their character's new abilities before moving forward. It shouldn't be every session, but after completing a milestone.

You did good... they wanted to keep going... they're just bad at showing gratitude. They were having fun in the moment, which says it all. If it was a bad session they wouldn't have wanted to keep going.

Those two seem like spoiled brats. Have one of them DM next game. Maybe that’ll build some empathy on their side.

Also, never let people say things like that to you. Never. Do not allow it. They might say you’re overreacting, you’re not. Nobody should suffer such offensive comments. It’s not cool, it’s not normal, it’s toxic and it has to stop.

If they do something like that once more, put your foot down. Stop the game. Whatever it takes.

4½ hours is a very long session for adults.

Teenagers whose lives revolve around D&D will sometimes play 8 hours at a time, but it's unreasonable of anyone to expect that.

I would say to them the next session, in person, something like this, politely: "Hey guys, you kinda hurt my feelings after last session with what you said. I do my best for you, and I'm only human, so playing longer would really ruin my fun. I'd also like to point out, no offense, that if I were doing such a bad job, you wouldn't want to play longer. If one of you wants to DM, you can, but you'll see it's much more tiring to manage several people than it is to manage one character."

Also, for that leveling up question, normal leveling up is only once every 2-5 sessions, and 2 is pretty quick. Ask them how long they want the campaign to be, because if you level up every season or every other session, a level 1-20 campaign would be less than a year.

One final note: If they keep hurting your feelings, you need to have a discussion with them about leaving the group. If they don't like you, then why would they want you around? They'll either realize what they're doing or they'll be dicks, in which case you don't play with them anymore. It really sucks if you're friends outside the game, but you can say "I'll hang out with y'all other times, but I don't want to play D&D with you because you hurt my feelings, and I'm not going to put the work in just to be put down like that."

It is was it is, dm have to prep stuff, and I feel mentally burnt after 5 hours. Sometimes I’ll tell the players that’s all I’ve got planed but if you want wonder town to buy stuff we can do that or whatever, nothing intense role playing.

We used to do 4-5 hour sessions, but it has shifted down lately to closer to 3. If you think of most any other game, a 3 hour play session would be considered long. ;)

Being a DM is basically like hosting an event (I mean I guess it quite literally is) in that you’ll have people that appreciate it and show you, people that appreciate it and don’t show you, and sometimes you get ungrateful people like your players. If you want to hone your skills it’s important to be able to pick out relevant criticism from all the BS. Otherwise just keep trucking on and trying new stuff… you have just as much of a right to have fun as they do… if they treat the campaign as being all about them they’re just wrong

Also hopping right into DMing is extremely hard. Whatever you did I assure you it was fantastic just by virtue of you taking the dive for your players & yourself

As for the length, run the sessions as long as you’d like but try to give your players a hard in/out time beforehand. If you say “session is 4-8pm” and they show up, they’ve agreed to this timeframe and that’s the end of it

You have to go along with everyone’s wishes, DM included for the time. I have a game with my DM which is only the two of us since we didn’t have more people to play at the time, and we can easily do 10-15 hours per sessions. We found a group and adjusted ourselves with their needs. You can’t ask for more hours if someone doesn’t want to, especially the DM who has to plan it all. I feel like they’re being a tad ungrateful the way they spoke to you.

Where do they get off saying you are a terrible DM and yet they want to play for longer? If you were a terrible DM then they wouldn't want to show up at all.

I prefer 3-4 hour sessions, though on occasion I do like going into the 6-7 hour range, especially if we’re making a day of it. But to each their own, and DMing (at least to me) is very rewarding but also incredibly draining.

That said, I wouldn’t want to DM for players that talk about people like that, it’s incredibly rude.

My kids fall asleep late, and wake up early. 3 hours is about the most I can handle without being a zombie wreck the next day.

Unfortunately, finding games with such short sessions is hard. Most seem to be at least 4 hours.

Tell them that you don't DM for dicks. They can try again, but they need to shape up. Don't be afraid to just kick them from the game. Some people, quite frankly, do not deserve to play TTPRGs.

No. 4 hours is a long time. I think if anything takes longer than a lord of the rings extended edition film, it needs to be either marriage or work related. I can't keep my attention on anything that long, which is why I'm not married and my job isn't going anywhere.

I run 2 hours sessions with a 3 hour max. Everyone has lives. I don't, but most people do.

No, you are good. It is actually a good thing that players want to keep playing. They might not be able to articulate their expectations and enjoyment that they get from playing very well, that's it.

I have been a Dm for 25 years and I also like sessions that are 41/2 hours long. That "level of DM" is bullshit.

Been DMing for years, and I typically run 4-4.5 hour sessions, now 3-3.5 in pandemic times (weirdly find it more draining than in person, despite not having to drive to/from the game).

Your friends sound like assholes. If someone spends hours doing something for you, you don't laugh about how bad they are at it, to their face or otherwise. You say thank you and if you have actual suggestions for things they could do better you raise them sensitively or not at all.

I’m late to this but I want to reassure you that you aren’t a bad DM, they are bad players. You aren’t some mystical being summoned at their beck and call to make them happy.

As others have said, attention spans wander, and you can only prep up so much. As a DM I’ve found that 2-3 hours is right for me, and that’s because my current group is more RP heavy so it’s a lot of conversations and laughing. I dread the idea of trying to prep 3+ combats each session.

If they want to play so much, let them DM a second campaign or some one shots. The whole “let’s rank our DM while he’s standing there” thing stinks of an abusive relationship. I’m not sure if they are your friends or just players, but don’t put up with that shit. No DnD is better than bad DnD, for DMs and players.

At my table, I run 2 hours every sunday. We have gone over a few times, but that seems to work best for us.

Here's and option for those demanding a longer session: I'll DM for my time, then you can prep and DM a second session right after.

This OP has like a dozen subjects, totally unrelated to its title. If I'm ranking OP's DMing by their journalism abilities, I think it's a solid -7/10.

But seriously I'm confused what the actual issue is, but if your friends are telling you that you did a shit job DMing them, don't DM for them again. Easy. Everyone wins

lol. Yeah, sorry for giving you crap, but the players sound really ungrateful. I don't think I'd volunteer to run another game for someone who said that to me.

Like I don't think players need to suck up to a DM for them to play, but if they're degrading you, fuck them. You put at least 10x as much effort into the session as they did, and they're giving you shit? Fuck em. Let them run it if they want to play

Here's the main points (from my understanding)

He's brand baby butt spanking new to the game, and is dm'ing for a group of people. Some of those individuals are acting like uptight Brittany's and Karen's and think that because a session isn't going as long as they want, believe that is the reason he's just not a good dm. This in turn, makes our new dm/player self conscious that maybe he sucks. The issue is he's trying to figure out if he really does suck as much as these players claim he does.

They do not sound like fun players. Our main group (not one that I DM) on average runs for about 3 hours, it will stretch to 4 hours but that last hour generally becomes more general chatter and wind down time. The other campaign my partner and I are in atm might go for 2 1/2 hours, more often than not it's 2 hours. For the first group we have done 6 hour sessions, but they're not common and will occur when something special is happening. For example, we did a 6 hour dungeon exploration puzzle solving extravaganza for our 50th session, but it was planned in advance, everyone knew we'd be playing for 6 hours and we had all stocked up on snacks and pizza for this purpose.

We're adults and we usually have other things to be doing. D&D is a great escape but it's not something most of us even have time to dedicate loads and loads of time in a day to.

I would say that running shorter sessions is a sign of a good GM. It's always better to end while everyone still want to play than the opposite. Also, the groups playing shorter sessions tend to get a lot more done in the time they play, making all more worthwhile and fun for everyone.

Basically, don't listen to your player. If they complain you end to early, you're doing your job well.

4 hours is a pretty long session.

It's really hard to prep much more content than that in advance.

Don't sweat it.

They have no baseline to compare you with as a DM except streamers. That's a rough comparison and one that seasoned DM's will counsel against applying to yourself.

Sounds like these are people used to video games and just playing without knowing anything about the hours of time it takes to actually run a session. I'd remind them that you are not a game development studio, just a single person.

I'll sound like a boomer here, but many people these days feel they need to have participation medals and level up when they haven't done anything to earn it. Remind them the game works in a certain way, and much of the game is working with people with feelings and their own things going on.
